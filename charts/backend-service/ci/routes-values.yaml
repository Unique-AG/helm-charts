# -- routes is a special object designed for Unique services. It abstracts a lot of complexity and allows for a simple configuration of routes.
# ⚠️ Unique defaults to Kong as its API Gateway (the middlewares especially), and the routes object is designed to work with Kong. If you are using a different API Gateway, you will need to use `extraRoutes`.
# Refer to [`ci/routes-values.yaml`](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/backend-service/ci/routes-values.yaml) to see a full example of how to configure routes.
# Currently, routes must be explicitly enabled until the Unique Kong migration is complete and Tyk faded out from the chart.
routes:
  # - hostname of the route, will be matched against the host header of the request
  # currently defaults to one, if ever more are needed open an issue, `extraHostNames` will be added, supports templating
