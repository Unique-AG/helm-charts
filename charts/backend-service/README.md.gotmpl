## Implementation Details

### OCI availibility
This chart is available both as Helm Repository as well as OCI artefact.
```sh
helm repo add unique https://unique-ag.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install my-{{ template "chart.name" . }} unique/{{ template "chart.name" . }} --version {{ template "chart.version" . }}

# or
helm install my-{{ template "chart.name" . }} oci://ghcr.io/unique-ag/helm-charts/{{ template "chart.name" . }} --version {{ template "chart.version" . }}
```

### Docker Images
The chart itself uses `ghcr.io/unique-ag/chart-testing-service` as its base image. This is due to automation aspects and because there is no specific `appVersion` or service delivered with it. Using `chart-testing-service` Unique can improve the charts quality without dealing with the complexity of private registries during testing. Naturally, when deploying the Unique product, the image will be replaced with the actual Unique image(s). You can inspect the image [here](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/tree/main/docker) and it is served from [`ghcr.io/unique-ag/chart-testing-service`](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/pkgs/container/chart-testing-service).

### CronJobs
`cronJob` as well as `extraCronJobs` can be used to create cron jobs. These convenience fields are easing the effort to deploy Unique as package. Technically one can also deploy this same chart multiple times but this increases the management complexity on the user side. `cronJob` and `extraCronJobs` allow to deploy multiple cron jobs in a single chart deployment. Note, that they all share the same environment settings for now and that they base on the same image. You should not use this feature if you want to deploy arbitrary or other CronJobs not related to Unique or the current workload/deployment.

⚠️ The syntax between `cronJob` and `extraCronJobs` is different. This is due to the continuous improvement process of Unique where unnecessary complexity has been abstracted for the user. You might still define every property as before, but the chart will default or auto-generate many of the properties that were mandatory in `cronJob`. Unique leaves is open to deprecate `cronJob` in an upcoming major release and generally advises, to directly use `extraCronJobs` for new deployments.

You can find a `extraCronJobs` example in the [`example-values/extra-cronjobs.yaml`](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/backend-service/example-values/extra-cronjobs.yaml) file.
