  The 'backend-service' chart is a "convenience" chart from Unique AG that can generically be used to deploy backend workloads to Kubernetes.

  Note that this chart assumes that you have a valid contract with Unique AG and thus access to the required Docker images.

    - kind: changed
      description: "values.yaml is now sorted alphabetically for readability, flat above nested."
    - kind: changed
      description: "service.port defaults back to 80 as now the application port is used instead for the Unique service. This change is non-breaking because users had to already set a specific port for the service in order to run as non-root using the RuntimeDefault securityContext."
    - kind: added
      description: "ports object, allows specifying ports for the service and deployment/application."
