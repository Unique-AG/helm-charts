# web-app

The 'web-app' chart is a "convenience" chart from Unique AG that can generically be used to deploy web-content serving workloads to Kubernetes.

Note that this chart assumes that you have a valid contract with Unique AG and thus access to the required Docker images.

![Version: 4.3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-4.3.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

## Implementation Details

### OCI availibility
This chart is available both as Helm Repository as well as OCI artefact.
```sh
helm repo add unique https://unique-ag.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install my-web-app unique/web-app --version 4.3.0

# or
helm install my-web-app oci://ghcr.io/unique-ag/helm-charts/web-app --version 4.3.0
```

### Docker Images
The chart itself uses `ghcr.io/unique-ag/chart-testing-service` as its base image. This is due to automation aspects and because there is no specific `appVersion` or service delivered with it. Using `chart-testing-service` Unique can improve the charts quality without dealing with the complexity of private registries during testing. Naturally, when deploying the Unique product, the image will be replaced with the actual Unique image(s). You can inspect the image [here](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/tree/main/docker) and it is served from [`ghcr.io/unique-ag/chart-testing-service`](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/pkgs/container/chart-testing-service).

### Networking
The chart supports the Gateway API and its resources. This is the recommended way to go forward. The Gateway API is a Kubernetes-native way to manage your networking resources and is part of the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io) project.

The Gateway API is enabled by default, you need to selectively `enable` different `routes` or use `extraRoutes` to configure them. See [Routes](#routes) for more information.

#### Routes
With `2.0.0` the chart supports _routes_ (namely all routes from [`gateway.networking.k8s.io`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#route-resources)). While `routes`, not yet enabled by default, abstract certain complexity away from the chart consumer, `extraRoutes` can be used by power-users to configure each route exactly to their needs.

To use _Routes_ per se you need two things:

- Knowledge about them and the Gateway API, you can start from these resources:
    + [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io)
    + [Route Resources](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#route-resources)
- CRDs installed
    + [Install CRDs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#getting-started-with-gateway-api)

##### HTTPS Redirects
Routes do not redirect to HTTPS by default. This redirect must be handled in the upstream services or extended via `extraAnnotations`. This is not due to a lack of security but the fact that the chart is agnostic to the upstream service and its configuration so enforcing a redirect can lead to unexpected behavior and indefinite redirects. Also, most modern browsers prefix all requests with `https` as a secure practice.

##### Root Route
The Root Route is a convenience Ingress/Gateway that routes all traffic from the root of the domain to the applied service. This functionality works different depending on the Ingress/Gateway Class used. In order to keep the chart agnostic to the Ingress Class, the chart uses the `.Capabilities.APIVersions` [built-in object](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/).

Only one root route per cluster (technically per hostname) should be deployed to avoid conflicts or race conditions respectively.

### Network Policies

The chart supports Kubernetes Network Policies to control traffic flow to and from pods. Network Policies are a Kubernetes-native way to implement network segmentation and can help improve security by restricting network communication.

#### Network Policy Flavors

The chart supports two network policy flavors:

- **`kubernetes`** (default): Standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources
- **`cilium`**: Cilium's CiliumNetworkPolicy resources with enhanced features

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  flavor: kubernetes  # or "cilium"
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    # Allow ingress from monitoring namespace
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: monitoring
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3000
  egress:
    # Allow egress to backend namespace
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: backend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
    # Allow external HTTPS/HTTP access
    - to: []
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
```

#### Kubernetes vs Cilium Differences

When using `flavor: cilium`, the chart will:
- Use `apiVersion: cilium.io/v2` and `kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy`
- Use `endpointSelector` instead of `podSelector` in the spec
- Support advanced Cilium-specific features in your rules

When using `flavor: kubernetes` (default), the chart will:
- Use `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1` and `kind: NetworkPolicy`
- Use standard `podSelector` in the spec
- Maintain compatibility with any Kubernetes CNI that supports NetworkPolicy

**Important Notes:**
- Network Policies require a CNI (Container Network Interface) that supports them, such as Calico, Cilium, or Weave Net
- For Cilium flavor, you must have Cilium CNI installed with CiliumNetworkPolicy CRDs
- Once a Network Policy is applied to a pod, it becomes "isolated" and only allowed traffic will be permitted
- Always include DNS resolution (port 53/UDP) in your egress rules if pods need to resolve hostnames
- Test your network policies thoroughly to avoid inadvertently blocking required traffic

You can find Network Policy examples in the [`ci/networkpolicy-values.yaml`](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/web-app/ci/networkpolicy-values.yaml) (Kubernetes) and [`ci/networkpolicy-cilium-values.yaml`](https://github.com/Unique-AG/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/web-app/ci/networkpolicy-cilium-values.yaml) (Cilium) files.

It abstracts a lot of complexity and allows for a simple configuration of routes. ⚠️ Unique defaults to Kong as its API Gateway (the middlewares especially), and the routes object is designed to work with Kong.

## Upgrade Guides

### ~> 3.0.0

- `routes` uses `camelCase` for its keys, replace all `lower_snake_case` keys with `camelCase`
- `routes.paths` and their sub-paths no longer use `/` as a prefix by default, add it to your `routes`

### ~> 2.0.0

- `httproute` is converted into a dictionary and moves into `extraRoutes`
- `ingress` has been removed. If you need `Ingress` back as routing option please open an issue on the repository explaining why.

## Development

If you want to locally template your chart, you must enable this via the `.Capabilities.APIVersions` [built-in object](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/)
```
helm template some-app oci://ghcr.io/unique-ag/helm-charts/web-app --api-versions appgw.ingress.azure.io/v1beta1 --values your-own-values.yaml
helm template some-app oci://ghcr.io/unique-ag/helm-charts/backend-service --api-versions gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 --values your-own-values.yaml
```
