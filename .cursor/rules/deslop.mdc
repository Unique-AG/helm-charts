All markdown files or templates (*.md, *.md.gotmpl files) must be deslopped.

When creating or modifying Markdown files or templates therefor omit or remove: 

- Filler phrases: "It's important to note that...", "Please keep in mind...", "As mentioned above..."
- Weasel adverbs: "simply", "just", "easily", "basically", "obviously", "clearly"
- Redundant explanations that repeat the same information in different words
- Excessive hedging: "might", "perhaps", "it could be argued that..."
- Marketing-speak and buzzwords: "leverage", "robust", "seamless", "cutting-edge"
- AI-generated closings: "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you have any questions!"
- Unnecessary introductions before getting to the point
- Over-formatted text (excessive bold, headers for single items, emoji overuse)
- Generic placeholder content that adds no real value
- Stating things that are already obvious from context or naming

Report at the end with only a 1-3 sentence summary of what you changed
