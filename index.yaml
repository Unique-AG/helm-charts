    description: 'The SSCSID ([Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/))
      Keeper (`sscsid-keeper`) is a chart that combines the often used `SecretProviderClass`,
      which is part of the SSCSID with a running deployment that mounts the matching
      secrets making them available to others within the same namespace.  This chart
      is a pet project of Unique to code more _DRY_ and not officially supported by
      the maintainers of the `Secrets Store CSI Driver`. Unique also prototypes new
      features, processes or ideas with this chart (e.g. chart signing). This chart
      is also not an official Helm chart of Unique AG and underlies no SLA or support
      even if used in production.  Since Unique is at the time of writing Azure focused,
      leveraging the Azure managed AKS CSI Extension is sometimes simpler than manually
      installing other Secret _solutions_.  Note that if you need more sophisticated
      features, or a officially maintained chart or option that supports reloading,
      ClusterSecrets etc, seek matching alternatives on your own behalf (e.g. [External
      Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/)). '
